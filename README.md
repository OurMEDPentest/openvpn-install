## openvpn-install
OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

### [BETA] Telegram-support
During the install you can set up Telegram supports and make a bot send a message to a group chat when clients connect or disconnect.
**This needs tests**

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShutdownRepo/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.
